##### Note on the writing sample

Because of the size of the overall Db2 SQL material, I'm including a link to (and a PDF of) a small sample. Please navigate through the [Db2 SQL content on IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/13?topic=db2-sql) or
[contact me](mailto:mikeawendel@gmail.com) if you need a larger sample.

#### Background

With hundreds of specific reference topics for SQL statements and built-in functions, in addition to hundreds of topics detailing SQL usage and Db2's internal catalog tables, the Db2 for z/OS SQL information is a complex
set of information that is vital to developers success with Db2 for z/OS. This information set includes complex SQL syntax, real-world SQL examples, and details about using SQL in an optimal way to take advantage of the unique
coupling between Db2 for z/OS and the IBM Z platform.

#### Process

New technical documentation was developed by early teaming with engineering, contributing to the product specifications, using Subject Matter Expert (SME) interviews, and through conducting extensive documentation reviews.
Product quality assurance testing, collabration with users, and usage analysis drove continous content changes. All content was written in DITA XML, using Oxygen XML Editor. This allowed me to leverage content reuse where possible,
like the in the Authorization and security sections of most statements, or in the descriptions of SQL keywords for similar statements.

#### Results

Db2 for z/OS documentation, a big part of which is the SQL Reference, consistently has some of the highest usage and engagement of any documentation on IBM.com, with approximatly 500K monthly page views. In addition, Db2 for z/OS
documentation has consistently high Net Promoter Scores (NPS), in the upper 80s and low 90s, indicating that users vuew the content as high quality, with high value.
