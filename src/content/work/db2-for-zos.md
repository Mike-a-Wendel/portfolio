##### Note on the writing sample

Because of the size of the overall Db2 SQL material, I'm including a link to (and a PDF of) a small sample. Please navigate through the [Db2 SQL content on IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/13?topic=db2-sql) or
[contact me](mailto:mikeawendel@gmail.com) if you need a larger sample.

#### Background

With hundreds of specific reference topics for SQL statements and built-in functions, and hundreds of topics detailing SQL usage and Db2's internal catalog tables, the Db2 for z/OS SQL information is a set of complex
documentation that is vital to developers success with Db2 for z/OS. This information set includes complex syntax, real-world examples, and details about using SQL in an optimal way to take advantage of the unique
coupling between Db2 for z/OS and the IBM Z platform.

#### Process

New technical documentation was developed by early teaming with engineering to contribute to product specifications, interviewing Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and by conducting extensive documentation reviews. Product quality assurance testing, user collaboration, and usage analysis drove continuous content changes and improvements. All content was written in DITA XML, using Oxygen XML Editor. This allowed me to leverage content reuse where possible, as in the Authorization and Security sections of most SQL statements, or in the descriptions of keywords for similar statements.

#### Results

The SQL Reference is the single largest piece of Db2 for z/OS documentation, which consistently has some of the highest usage and engagement metrics of any documentation on IBM.com, with approximately 500K monthly page views. In addition, Db2 for z/OS documentation has consistently high Net Promoter Scores (NPS) -- in the upper 80s and low 90s -- indicating that users view the content as high value and high quality.
