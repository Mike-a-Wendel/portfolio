#### Background

In this particular project, teams located in China, Germany, and California joined forces to develop and launch the first release of Db2 for z/OS Data Gate. This cloud service replicates Db2 for z/OS data to a cloud environment, providing users with a seamless and efficient experience. However, the product’s success depended on delivery of comprehensive documentation given the complexity of the backend setup and configuration.

With a tight deadline of just two months, a globally distributed team, and little to no formal design specifications, delivering complete and accurate documentation was going to be challenging. Additionally, maintaining documentation consistency with other cloud services in the same environment was paramount for a seamless user experience.

#### Process

By leveraging constant communication, regular meetings, and a shared documentation platform, I was able to closely collaborate with a writer in Germany, working together towards complete, user-friendly, highly technical documentation. Despite the physical distance and time differences, our consolidated efforts facilitated subject matter expert (SME) interviews across the globe. These interviews and hands-on product usage were key sources that informed the documentation.

Careful information architecture, based on an in-depth understanding of the user’s tasks and the product’s workflow, allowed us to appropriately scope the documentation for our limited resources and timeframe.

Working in a shared repository and writing content in DITA XML enabled peer-reviews and edits of each other's writing early and often, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

#### Results

We successfully delivered complete and accurate technical documentation on time for the launch of Db2 for z/OS Data Gate, including over 50 concept, task, and reference topics to the IBM Documentation platform. In addition, we did a complete edit of all user interface text, and a user interface task analysis which resulted in changes to simplify the product's workflow.

Prior to the release, I also authored a community announcement blog post to help raise customer awareness.
